## Introduction

Welcome to the AWS section of the DevStartOps repository!

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform offering a wide range of services, from compute power to storage solutions, and everything in between. AWS is a cornerstone of modern cloud infrastructure and is integral to many DevOps practices.

## Why AWS?

Consider a startup that needs to deploy a new application quickly and scale it as demand grows. By leveraging AWS, the startup can deploy its application on scalable cloud infrastructure, use managed services to handle databases and monitoring, and easily adjust resources based on traffic, all without the need for physical servers.
